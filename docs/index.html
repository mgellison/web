A graduate of Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, Ellison has held research positions at Stanford University and the Hoover Institution. Earlier in his career, he worked with award-winning public broadcasters Christopher Lydon and Mary McGrath at WBUR’s Radio Open Source in Boston, directed Georgetown’s International Relations Institute under Professor Anthony Clark Arend, and led operations and ceremonies for NAIMUN, the largest student-run Model United Nations conference in the world, hosting more than 3,000 delegates annually.

Ellison was raised in a Catholic family whose roots trace to England, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Ukraine, Switzerland, and the Philippines, with ancestors who settled in Boston and New York in the generations before the First World War. Since 2024, he has made annual pilgrimages to Chartres in France and has undertaken a pilgrimage to Mount Athos in Greece. He has studied sacred liturgy and theology with the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest and is currently writing a book on the history of metaphysics and its relationship to the liturgy in Western history.
