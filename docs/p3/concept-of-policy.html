<p><br /><strong>I. PURPOSE OF MEMORANDUM</strong></p>
<p>This memorandum is written with a view of setting down systematically a concept of policy relevant to current questions of organization.</p>
<p>Of discussion and data regarding foreign policy there is no end. Probably never before in history has a people given attention so exhaustively and pervasively to the national relationships to those matters lying beyond the span of national jurisdiction. The great secular change in our public life in recent years had been the shift of the main focus from the problems of internal development to the factors of national security in world relations. This reflects itself in the contents of our newspapers, in the character of public and private discourse, in the topics of sermons, and in innumerable other ways. The volume of governmental publication in this field is vast. That of non governmental character is measureless.</p>
<p>So whatever the causes of want of understanding, of the sense of frustration, and of the actual shortcomings in performance in this field, surely they are not to be found in quantitative lack of information and descriptive material.</p>
<p>More important as cause is a want of analytic insight. Most of us &mdash;&nbsp;as officers of the Government and as citizens as well &mdash;&nbsp;give relatively so much attention to the content of our foreign policy and bother so little about clarifying our ideas as to the inherent nature of foreign policy. In the scholastic sense of the terms, we spend so much time on the accidental characteristics to neglect the essential characteristics.</p>
<p>This memorandum attempts to deal with the essential characteristics of foreign policy as a thing itself rather than with the accidental characteristics of one particular foreign policy. The purpose is not merely an academic one. It is rather the practical one of trying to bring a little light on a set of problems of constant concern to all of us.</p>
<p>The method of definition has been chosen not on the basis of a claim of exclusive correctness for the meaning of the key words as used but solely with a view of ensuring understanding of the principal ideas.</p>
<p><br /><strong>II. BASIC RELEVANT TERMS</strong></p>
<p>Two simple starting propositions not likely to arouse serious dispute: (a) that the State is a sort of short-hand expression for the continuing entity of a group of human beings inhabiting a defined territory and politically organized under one government and thus capable of acting corporately with respect to matters both within and beyond that territory, and (b) that foreign policy involves project of the will of the State with respect to matters external to that territory.</p>
<p>In the face of any challenge to these propositions, it is necessary to preserve only two ideas as essential to the rest of the things to be said: (a) that foreign policy involves the projection of will and (b) that the entity whose will is concerned is composed of human beings and therefore is finite. True, we tend to abstract our terms regarding the State, but our use of impersonal and institutional words conceals but does not alter the human character of the agents making decisions in its sphere.</p>
<p>Let us turn now to the function of choice, definable as the determining from among two or more possibilities that possibility which is preferred to the exclusion of the rest.</p>
<p>The exclusion of alternative possibilities by choice may be final and irrevocable. It may be temporary and revocable. This depends on the attendant circumstances. This does not invalidate the proposition that any act of choice entails for the term of its effect the renunciation of alternatives.</p>
<p>In the scholastic view, the necessity of choice devolves even upon an Infinite Being, limited in power in the sense of being incapable of bringing inherently incompatible things to reality together. Not only this but also an additional circumstance devolves upon finite beings the recurring necessity of choice. This additional circumstance is the limitation of means. Nothing mortal is ever capable of doing all of the things that it would do if it were capable of doing everything that it might wish to do. Thus for men and their institutions the necessity of choice arises not only when alternative possibilities are inherently incompatible but also when they are together practicably unfeasible.</p>
<p>The faculty of being able to make ordered choices we may identify as will.</p>
<p>The exercise of the faculty, as distinct from the faculty itself, we call volition &ndash;&nbsp;meaning the completion of an act of choosing &ndash;&nbsp;that is, the act of establishing a preference for one possibility to the exclusion of alternatives.</p>
<p>Now let us look briefly at the levels of volition.</p>
<p>The first level is that which spurs the mind to volition. Let us call this a motive. It arises from some inner and antecedent need or desire. Standing alone, it is neither good nor evil.</p>
<p>The second is that which the mind conceives as being, if realized, capable of satisfying the need or desire identified as source to the motive. This we may call an end.</p>
<p>Unlike motives, ends relate to a scheme of values, that is, they bear upon the question of good and evil. Yet ends are susceptible of being conceived in absolute terms &ndash;&nbsp;that is, without regard to the existence of means fore achieving them. So long as remaining in the mind unrelated to means they stand beyond the range of human judgment. They enter into the scope of human judgement &ndash;&nbsp;whether it be legal judgment, practical judgment, or ethical judgment &ndash;&nbsp;only when brought into a relationship with means.</p>
<p>Let me put this another way. One who goes only so far as being spurred to like the ideas of one thing in preference to another and projecting no action about the attainment of it is only wishing. An evil wish not persecuted is beyond the realm of temporal punishment. Likewise a good wish without endeavor merits no reward.</p>
<p>It is only when the process of volition is carried on to the selection of means for devotion to an end that one approaches the field of the vital test, where success is courted and failure risked.</p>
<p>This brings us to the third level of volition &ndash;&nbsp;namely, intention.</p>
<p>We establish relationship [sic] between means and ends only at the level of intention, where the mind adds to the conception of ends the projection of action in pursuit of them.</p>
<p>The capacity to conceive ends is unlimited. The means to achieve them &ndash;&nbsp;remember we are talking here of finite beings &ndash;&nbsp;is always limited. The situation of desiring more than one can attain is the human situation.</p>
<p>Thus ends tend to conflict in competing for the allocation of means, and one must resolve conflict by arranging his ends in a hierarchy on the basis of which he can determine the order of priority or the ratios for allocation for devoting his means to the pursuit of them.</p>
<p>To put it another way &ndash;&nbsp;decision at the stage forming an intention involves bringing ends and means into balance by extracting some of the ends or parts of them for pursuit and putting aside the rest &ndash;&nbsp;and if solvency characterizes what is done at this stage, those ends or portions of ends selected out for pursuit must not be in excess of what one can do to realize them.</p>
<p>Those portions of one's whole range of ends selected out and matched with one's means let us identify as purposes. Purposes &ndash;&nbsp;let us repeat &ndash;&nbsp;are those portions of ends chosen to be acted upon.</p>
<p><br /><strong>III. THE DETERMINING IMPORTANCE OF MEANS</strong></p>
<p>This leads to some generalizations about the economy of means.</p>
<p>Though our ends in their whole range immediately exceed our means, our purposes must always be in balance with our means, for otherwise they come into contradiction and propel us toward insolvency.</p>
<p>This balance is not solely a quantitative matter. Not only must our means be sufficient to our purposes but also they must be qualitatively appropriate to our purposes.</p>
<p>An institution or an individual must take care to avoid the self-frustrations resulting from spending on the pursuit of one purpose the means essential to the pursuit of another and from devoting to any purpose a means incapable of realizing it or likely to obstruct a concurrent purpose.</p>
<p>A purpose achieved becomes the means for achieving further purposes. Thus the economy of means also requires that the ends selected out as purposes for action be such as, if achieved, will provide the best feasible basis in means for going on to further purposes; that is, so far as possible we must project our purposes so as best we can to progress toward our ends or, if we cannot so progress, at least to minimize the setbacks we must suffer with respect to them.</p>
<p>Use of means is a cost. Achievement of a purpose represents gain. It is easy to wish a gain. The difficult part is always the envisaging of the cost. Yet, as Jeremy Bentham well pointed out, the forming of an intention requires the accepting of the cost as well as entertaining the gain. An intention is truly formed only at the stage of the acceptance of those aspects despite which as well as those aspects because of which one acts.</p>
<p>My main point here is that policy can be knowingly conceived and responsibly dealt with only if understood as bearing on the schemes of intentions and therefore as subject to all the disciplines arising from the limitations of means and the necessity of keeping purposes in balance with them. If we do not so conceive of policy and interpret it, we are too likely to stray off into the fallacy of thinking that making a policy entails only thinking up our wishes. To do that results in wanton rather than responsible performance.</p>
<p>This implies no idea decrying or demeaning the importance of the ends conceived as absolute &ndash;&nbsp;that is, irrespectively of means. The totality of ends thus conceived provides the measure for evaluating our performance in the limited and acting short-run decisions that generate policy. It is only by knowing what we should like ultimately to reach that we can tell whether we are heading the right way and gaining or losing ground in the short haul.</p>
<p>Yet we must recognize that in speaking of our ends as a Nation in the world we have only made a beginning &ndash;&nbsp;have only done the easiest part &ndash; in the whole process of making a policy. The hard part is in finding and allocating the means, in making those choices and renunciations involved in deciding what portions of our ends to pursue at a given stage and what ones to defer.</p>
<p>We must remember also that we have not really marshaled ourselves for performance in this field until we have willed the costs as well as the gains &ndash;&nbsp;have apprised ourselves of all the aspects militating against an action as well as those commending it &ndash;&nbsp;and have brought ourselves to accept these along with the putative gains.</p>
<p>All this seems obvious to the point of banality, and yet one often notes evidences of a failure to take this realistic view of the meaning of policy into account.</p>
<p>For example, the whole literature in the National Security Council framework seems to lack focus with respect to the considerations discussed. It defines with respect to a whole range of areas and situations the things which the United States Government would like to achieve. It sheds negligible light on the question of how and in what order to proceed toward the realization of them.</p>
<p>There comes to mind also a recent instance in which someone responsible in the line of policy remarked with respect to a prospective revision of policy for a given area that the job would consist of redefining our goals. Another individual raised the question of relating them to our capabilities, and the first individual replied that the question of capabilities would be left to subordinate elements to figure out afterwards.</p>
<p>That sort of approach just does not involve making policy, as I understand the term. The fashioning of ends without regard to means may be a delightful and exhilarating exercise for a time, but the bearing it has on serving the interests of the United States in the real situation is negligible.<br /> <br />At best a nation's control of its destiny is only partial. So many of the things bearing upon its course lie beyond its fist. Even within that portion where it has jurisdiction there is no way of escaping the effect of antecedent facts. These invariably limit the area of choice in any instance. Thus what use a nation makes of the choices vouchsafed will count in but will not alone determine its course. Within its area of freedom a nation must give heed to the means every bit as rigorously as to the purposes.</p>
<p>The tragic evils of the life of a nation are so commonly unintentional, so commonly the consequences of not paying proper heed to the means. Where the course undertaken leads is so often drastically worse than the goal imagined. This is the same as in individual life. Of all the men in Sing Sing probably not one chose Sing Sing as his goal. Faults in the choice of means got them where they are.</p>
<p>Making a foreign policy is not a job of figuring out what a nation would like to do but a job of determining what a nation is going to do. Inherently it relates not simply to attitudes and desires but to actions and purposes.</p>
<p>Approaching policy without regard to the iron necessities of bringing purposes into balance with means courts not merely futility but also the danger of violence. Certainly the history of German diplomacy in the era after Bismarck demonstrates the real dangers inherent in attempting to substitute pronouncement for reality and establishing purposes beyond the reach of the means at hand. History is replete with similar instances of governments which overreached, committing themselves overtly to undertakings which they could not fulfill and in consequence incurring war.</p>
<p>The process, once begun, is most difficult to stop. A government proclaims aims in excess of its means to affect them. Becoming anxious over the disparity between what it can do and what it has proclaimed as its goal, it seeks to redress the disparity by even more strident assertions of even wider aims. Eventually the range of assertions and the range of achievability become so obviously and completely disparate that the nation's policy is threatened with bankruptcy. The government concerned then faces the temptation to resort to pure and simple coercion to redress the imbalance. Thus the course of proclaiming goals beyond the margins of capability provided by the available means tends to lead to war.</p>
<p><br /><strong>IV. THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS IN SETTING A POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Let us see what are the crucial aspects of making a policy &ndash;&nbsp;of selecting from among our ends those parts to be established as purposes in balance with our means.</p>
<p>The easiest part, to repeat, is the defining of the ends.</p>
<p>The exacting work begins when one undertakes to extract purposes from among the ends and bring them into balance with means.</p>
<p>This relates to the time-phasing of a policy. One must conceive of purposes in sequence ahead, each purpose when achieved becoming the means for the achievement of further purposes.</p>
<p>This is the business of seeing to the generation of means ahead &ndash;&nbsp;of keeping a policy solvent through as long a range of the future as is susceptible of being brought into calculation.</p>
<p>All this relates to the quantitative appraisal of the relationship between purposes and means in the present end and in the range of time ahead.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the exacting work is that of seeing that the means qualitatively fit the purposes &ndash;&nbsp;of ensuring that there are not contradictions between the means we may choose and the things we hope to achieve by them or between the means we choose for one purpose and the realization of some concurrent purposes.</p>
<p>Only when we have scanned our project purposes by the measure of such standards can we say that together they constitute a respectable policy.</p>
<p>Now if policy in the framework of national security involved physical and concrete factors solely, the testing of balance between means and purposes, and the appraisal of appropriateness of means, the time-phasing would be simple enough.</p>
<p>All policy relates to the interaction of wills, however, and this is never susceptible of the same precise calculations as achievable in the concrete frames of activity.</p>
<p>This does not mean that it is all a matter of guesswork; one person is as good as another in the business of guessing. Quite the contrary, it is a matter of sharp and exacting estimate &ndash; requiring rather than, or besides, concrete precision a combination of insight, experience, and hard cerebation [sic].</p>
<p>Let us look at some of the essential characteristics following from the circumstance that policy is a pattern of intention, and that the world contains many nations each with its own patterns of intention. These combine to give us the obvious conclusion that world affairs involve a continuously changing pattern of intentions.</p>
<p>The adjustment of patterns of intention among individuals and institutions is integral to all human relations, including politics. All morals in society, whether individuals or organized groups, go continuously through the business of prevailing upon others to form or to alter intentions to accommodate their own or of acceding to others by changing their own intentions.</p>
<p>The two general ways of altering patterns of intention are through acting upon the end-content and through acting upon the mean-content. To put it more simply &ndash;&nbsp;the two ways of having one's way are, first, persuading others that what one wants to do fits in with what they want to do and, second, seeing to it that those disposed to act contrarily to what one wants do not have the chance to do so.</p>
<p>The first of the above ways of bringing about adjustment of intention we may call consent.</p>
<p>That to which one gives consent &ndash;&nbsp;that to which one accedes out of recognition of a sharing of purposes, of a community of ends &ndash;&nbsp;elicits esteem. WE may call this attribute &ndash;&nbsp;for lack of a better term &ndash;&nbsp;authority.</p>
<p>The second of the above ways of bringing about adjustment of intention we may call coercion.</p>
<p>The ultimate form of coercion is force &ndash;&nbsp;by which is meant the act of expending energy upon adversaries so as to impair their means.</p>
<p>The essence of political organization is the establishment of a monopoly of the right to use force within a given area.</p>
<p>In all political organization the effort to ensure the vesting with authority of the group vested with the monopoly of force is made. That is to say, in all governmental systems it is recognized as vital that those who must obey should esteem their magistrates as the exponents of their own interests.</p>
<p>Political organization inheres in the establishment of monopoly to the rightful use of force in a given area.</p>
<p>The difference between the constitutional and the unconstitutional ordering of government turns inherently upon the question whether the characteristic of authority is considered antecedent to the establishment of the monopoly of force or vice versa.</p>
<p>The institutions of a constitutional order are shaped to ensure that only those characterized by authority&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that is, endowed with esteem as the servants of the purposes of the community shall be permitted to control the monopoly of force.</p>
<p>The institutions of an unconstitutional order are shaped to ensure those controlling the monopoly of force shall have a claim upon authority.</p>
<p>In the one case government aims at the elimination of fear.</p>
<p>In the other case government seeks the heightening of fear.</p>
<p>In the constitutional view of politics authority must be primary. The esteem of the governed for their magistrates flowing out of a recognition of service to common ends must be the condition precedent for magistracy. All rightful power of government is viewed as derivative from and contingent upon the consent of the governed.</p>
<p>This essential principle may be manifested in a variety of ways in practice. The forms may be those of responsible monarchy, of aristocracy, or of generalized participation in the decision-making process. Whatever the form, the essential requirement is the absence of coercion from the process of determining the purpose for which coercion may be applied. The power fo government being derivative, it is feasible to establish exemption from its scope. Government is thus essentially limited government.</p>
<p>In the opposite view of politics, the monopoly on force is primary. On the basis of it those installed in power seek authority by instilling those subject to their power a belief in a. Community of ends served by a monopolized force. This, however, is simply a device for improving and perpetuating the monopoly. Coercion is applied in the process of determining the purposes of government as well as in enforcing the purposes after determination. Those vested with the monopoly are continuously and deeply aware of the derivative and therefore false and fragile nature of their authority. They tend to become keenly anxious about possible rival institutions having real claim to authority and therefore to use the force at their command to stamp out and forestall all such potential rivals. This results in the presumption of power in all fields.</p>
<p>These differences are relevant not only to the distinction between the limited end constitutional order within the state on the one hand and the police state and totalitarianism on the other. It applies in a parallel way to the conditions of relationships between nations.</p>
<p>War is the situation in which politically organized groups resort to the use of force so as to bring about adjustments in patterns to intention. It is the situation in which the contestants resort fo the most direct effort to bring about submission by reduction of the means available to their adversaries.</p>
<p>Peace is the situation in which politically organized groups seek the adjustment of patterns of intention through working out community of purposes.</p>
<p>Coercion is the genius of the one situation [i.e., of war], and consent of the other [i.e., of peace].</p>
<p>This does not mean to imply an absolute mutual exclusion between war and peace in terms of coercion and consent. True, our world has experienced &ndash;&nbsp;and it may be approaching a condition of war so nearly absolute that the elements of consent tend to disappear entirely, but no peace so perfect that all coercive elements have been obviated is attainable so long as men are not angels.</p>
<p>The difference between war and peace in essence is as to what is basic and what is derivative as between consent and force.</p>
<p>Our adversary in the present world struggle conceives all political relations in a framework of war. His view of life and mind rules out the possibility of that moral basis of will necessary for believing in free choice and uncoerced [sic] volition. The nature of all circumstances is, in his view, coercive, and so the line between war and peace becomes to him an unreal distinction.</p>
<p>We must not permit the difference between him and ourselves to lose its validity &ndash;&nbsp;perhaps I should say its clarity.</p>
<p>To stand as the exponent of peace &ndash;&nbsp;that is, of international relations in the genius of consent tending toward the elimination of fear as the arbiter as distinct from international relations in the framework of coercion and the aggrandizement of fear &ndash;&nbsp;we must abide by the necessity of choosing means consistent therewith.</p>
<p>The world will know us and history judge us not by the ends we proclaim so much as the methods we select for attempting to progress toward them.</p>
<p>Consent is slow business. Only coercion is quick. Consent is not precisely predictable. Only coercion can work with sure steps to definitive conclusions. Consent requires patience and reappraisal. Only coercion permits exigency and finality.</p>
<p>In establishing a policy &ndash;&nbsp;in working out the factors that tie means and purposes together in determining the time-phases for the achievements we project &ndash;&nbsp;we must avoid the temptation to seek the degree of precision and conclusiveness available only by the employment of coercive means, for in the degree in which we give way to this temptation we tend to act in contradiction to the values we espouse.</p>
<p>This means in practice that the content and time-phasing of our policy must be subjected to continuous reappraisal. This is so not because dalliance and contingency are virtues but because compulsion a vice in the conduct of international relations on the basis of consent.</p>
<p>From the circumstances that the growth of modern techniques has accelerated some of the processes integral to international conduct we tend too much to conclude that it has speeded up all of them.</p>
<p>It is all too easy to fall into the idea that the process of winning consent can be accelerated just as the process of building a dam or blowing up a bridge.</p>
<p>This is not so. To the contrary, the process of thinking is not more rapid than it was in the past; and the greater number and complexity of the facets of the issues among nations today in contrast to former times make greater rather than reduce the time required for establishing concurrences through processes of thought and agreement.</p>
<p>We see this in the circumstance that while the physical processes of destruction and construction have been accelerated in comparison to a century ago, it nevertheless takes longer to establish a treaty restoring peace in the sequel to war than it did a century ago.</p>
<p>This is not because peace-makers have lagged in failing to apply to their tasks the arts of the production line but because peace-making is not susceptible of the same methods of industrial process.</p>
<p>If we are to proceed by consent, we must abide by the timetables of consent &ndash;&nbsp;not by the timetables of compulsion &ndash;&nbsp;and yield some of the fancied advantages of hurrying along to early conclusiveness.</p>
<p><br /><strong>V. CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
<p>Policy is not simply a matter of goals. It is a matter of matching capabilities and purposes in a carefully calculated and time-phased program which keeps means and purposes in continual balance as to type and to amount.</p>
<p>This relationship between purposes and means is a matter of intentions.</p>
<p>World relations consist of the continuous adjustment of patterns of intention among nations.</p>
<p>The continuous adjustment of our own pattern of intentions must take place concurrently with and in response to adjustments of such patterns among those nations setting in concert with us and those acting in opposition to us.</p>
<p>This requires elasticity along with precision in the relating of means and purposes integral to the making of policy.</p>
<p>We cannot afford to let our policy freeze to the formulas of purposes and means established at any one juncture. We must continually reappraise in the light of the data available. A policy which rigidifies around any particular formulation and time-phasing of means is one in which the means have become dominant.</p>
<p>Above all we must not settle on timetables of achievement fulfillable only by coercion, for that carries us along to the abandonment of the principles of consent and down the road to war.</p>
