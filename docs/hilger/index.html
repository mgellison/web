		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>Gustav Arthur Hilger (September 11, 1886 – July 27, 1965) was a German diplomat and expert on the Soviet Union. He was best known for his role in German–Soviet relations during the interwar period as a Counselor at the German embassy in Moscow. After World War II, he advised the United States and West German governments on Soviet issues. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Hilger">Read more</a> on Wikipedia.)</p>

		<p>Despite Hilger&#8217;s central role at the intersection of German, Soviet, and American relations during consequential years from the 1930s through the 1950s, he remains a relatively obscure figure.</p>

		<p>A student of 20th century history—especially diplomatic history concerning great powers, geopolitics, ideology, and strategy—might consider learning about Gustav Hilger, his life and his work. This non-profit research library provides relevant documents and reference material to help such a student in this aim.</p>

         <p>In October 2007, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) released approximately 300 pages of archival documents related to Gustav Hilger and his work with the U.S. government. (These documents are declassified and in the public domain. Most of these documents are contained within a single <b><a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/73088998">digitized Hilger file in the NARA Catalog</a></b>.) The documents vary in legibility and historical significance. We have begun the process of organizing and transcribing these documents so that they may be more easily accessed and studied.</b></p>
